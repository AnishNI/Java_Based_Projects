Project Based on Small Scale Class
This project is based on JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and simulates a small-scale class admission process. It handles various aspects like student admissions, teacher management, and fee integration. All of these processes are performed by interacting with a database, where records for students, teachers, and fees are stored and managed efficiently.
